docker volume
########################
Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:

* Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
* You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
* Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
* Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
* Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.
* New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.
* Volumes on Docker Desktop have much higher performance than bind mounts from Mac and Windows hosts.
* In addition, volumes are often a better choice than persisting data in a container’s writable layer, because a volume does not increase the size of the containers using it, and the volume’s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container.
