Dockerfile
##############
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

Docker runs instructions in a Dockerfile in order. A Dockerfile must begin with a FROM instruction.
