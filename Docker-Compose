Docker Compose
-----------------
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
* Start, stop, and rebuild services
* View the status of running services
* Stream the log output of running services
* Run a one-off command on a service

The Compose file is a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application.
