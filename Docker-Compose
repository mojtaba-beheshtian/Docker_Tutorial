Docker Compose
-----------------
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
* Start, stop, and rebuild services
* View the status of running services
* Stream the log output of running services
* Run a one-off command on a service

The Compose file is a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application.

docker-compose up -d

docker-compose down

docker-compose ps
#show list containers that up with docker-compose

docker-compose up --scale web=3 -d
#scale one of or more services	 if dont have any port expose and dont have container_name in compose file.

The docker compose run command allows you to run one-off commands for your services:

 docker compose run web env

Pass --volumes to also remove the data volume used by the Redis container:


 docker compose down --volumes
